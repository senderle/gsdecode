Up to about its primary school days a child thinks, naturally, 
only of play. But many a form of play contains disciplinary factors. 
"You can't do this," or "that puts you out," shows a child that it 
must think, practically or fail. Now, if, throughout childhood, a 
brain has no opposition, it is plain that it will attain a position 
of "status quo," as with our ordinary animals. Man knows not why a 
cow, dog or lion was not born with a brain on a par with ours; why 
such animals cannot add, subtract, or obtain from books and 
schooling, that paramount position which Man holds today.
