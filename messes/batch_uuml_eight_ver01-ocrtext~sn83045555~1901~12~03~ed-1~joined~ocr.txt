trade is worth but little but their strategic Importance is considered great ns a strong power might from these Islands s control the Caribbean sea and nnl the approaches to the gulf and the Isthmus It this country purchases tho Islands It is for their value specially Then there Is another consideration Denmark has long been anxious to dispose of these possessions which are an annual drain on her resources But tho United States Is not willing for any of the largo European powers ower to obtain them It follows that when Denmark placed them on tho market this country had no other recourse than thanto to buy them since we ve could not con both refuse to purchase and protest against the purchase by all oth other er powers That would be equivalent ent to an attempt at compelling a Email country to keep a possession po It does not nOI This country can better afford to pay tho comparatively small Sum asked than to Interfere with the ne negotiations between Denmark and an another other

defenders of those murderous criminals who seek to ex ru rUle e their criminality by that thatit it Is exercised for political ends In against wealth and power Hut for thin assassination even this
