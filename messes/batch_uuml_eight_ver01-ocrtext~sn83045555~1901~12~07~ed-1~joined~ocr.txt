age depend almost entirely upon that which was ie in past ages The doctrine of present revelation Is not entertained by bya a very Cr great many people Those who whohave whohave have been be n trained In the doctrines of ofmodern modern Christianity and who are paid to teach the people religious doctrines believe that Ovid O did reveal In former times but that Ho does not do so In these latter times They The be bellovo that God spake to the ancients by tho prophets and that Jesus of Nazareth whom they believe Is the Christ came to reveal the Will of His lis Father to mankind and that the Apostles whom Ho chose wont out with divine authority to proclaim his Gospel to tothe tothe totime the world but for many centuries they theyhave theyhave have entertained the notion that tho last book which Is placed In tho vol volume ume called the Bible contains the final revelation of God to mankind There Therefore fore they do not accept any nn revelation from God today do not ask sk for

on taking tho oath of he pledged himself to curry out absolutely un unbroken unbroken unbroken broken the policy of President MCI ley Ho was making a promise pr that tie ie e could not keep No living man could havo followed out outthe outthe outthe the course cour of the late President who whohad whohad whohad had no equal in the history of the coun country try as a manipulator of men The real really really ly great cr nt things that he did wero hard for him but they would have been Im Impossible Clod possible possible of performance by any other otherman er man us an Under the circumstances It Is to Roosevelts noo w credit that he made that pledge pled o at Buffalo Ills own heart was deeply stirred by grief and he had hadhad hadhad had brou ht home to him the sense of the nations nations loss and a realization of oftho oftho ofthe tho wonderful capacity for statesman of tho man In n whose footsteps ho howould howould howould would have to follow Ho spoke from fromtho fromtho fromthe tho fullness of his heart But now looking at It with a cool mind ho how It will bo to square per performance how er formance with promise no matter now hard ho tries Look at some of

hall been forgotten It Is Isevident Isevident Isevident evident that his policy will be aban abandoned dOlled by his party Mr Roosevelt lt Is Isstill still for reciprocity but It Is clear that thatho thatho thathe ho has become helpless of press to do any an tiling this season He Hewill Hewill will will urge urge recIprocity but It will re require require quire another congressional election be

strong pleas IIl ns for such action ac action tion Had Mr McKinley lived lie would havo favored this relief for Cuba No Noone Noone one doubts that he would have succeed succeeded ed Whether Pr Roosevelt noo eolt will succeed or fall will depend not on his hi power to smooth Congress the right way at the same time holding a strong hand on tho reins as Mr McKlnley would have done but on his ability to toget toget toget get the support of the citizens of the theUnited theUnited United Status on this moral Issue U President would have had in influence in Congress plus public support President Pr Roosevelt will have only onl thd publlo support Then hel there la the tariff which Is In Involved Involved in the reciprocity question It was clear that the late President PrL was growing to favor a of ofthe oftho the duties Ho would have begun his campaign In Congress nt tho se session Mon now neat at hand and ho would havo curried his point at the next Hessian What will tho ho new President ItO The impression lhl In that In his message ho hoWill hewill howill Will advise ndl e tho putting aside of all tariff discussion for the present In Inthis Inthis n this ho Is following the advice of Con Congress Congress Congres gress individually expressed Thus Congress Is giving advice to itself Then as to the upbuilding of the mer merchant merchant merchant chant marine President McKInley was not strongly In favor of tho bill of tho liut la t Congress IC but ho was wn an earnest cato of government aid to American shipping and his last speech showed that he was aIJ prepared to take up the question and urge It with all hiD power President Roosevelt will bring this thisquestion thISquestion thisquestion question to the attention of Congress hut It Is not n guess to say that will be no ship subsidy sub ld legislation at atthe the th coming session of Congress That ThatIs Is a certainty These things do not mean that tho thenew new w President lre will fall In his efforts to complete the McKlnley policy nut Butthey they certainly cert do mean that President PresidentRoosevelt Roosevelt coming to the Presidency tinder circumstances un tiled In tho walks of legislation and knowing nothing of the adroit ways of oftho ottho ofthe tho men In Congress who have been n results at Washington r JUST BEFORE Y SESSION all their lives by diplomacy nnd silence will not succeed
